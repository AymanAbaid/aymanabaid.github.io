I am a PhD candidate at the School of Computer Science, University of Galway, supervised by <a href='#'>Ihsan Ullah</a>. My research focuses on deep learning, generative models, and robust representation learning. In particular, I apply deep learning techniques to medical image analysis, spanning both practical applications and fundamental research. Key areas of interest include generative models, domain adaptation, and text-to-image and video synthesis.

Outside my research Iâ€™m training for my first marathon, exploring new places when I can, and enjoying a good book or two each month.
